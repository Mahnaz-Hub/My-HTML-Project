        <li>I started Zibaei Art Gallery as a quiet rebellion against a world that often forgets to pause and admire beauty.</li>
        <li>Zibaei Art Gallery is not just a gallery, it is a sanctuary- for dreams, lovers of beauty, and anyone who still believe in magic. </li>
        <li>I paint not just with colors, but with feelings. </li>
        <li>I believe art has the power to heal, and Zibaei Art Gallery is my way of sharing that light with the world.üåÜ</li>
